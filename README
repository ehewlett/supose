SupoSE

If you like to build yourself you have to install 
ini4j before you can compile via Maven 2.

The local installation of ini4j is needed, cause currently the
up-to-date releases of ini4j only support Java 1.6

The old release 0.2.6 of ini4j is Java 1.5 compatible.


Currently the commons-cli-2.0 is not released officially.
I have take a checkout from ASF and build a jar file myself.
Currently there is no SNAPSHOT Release nor an beta release
in any Maven 2 Repository available.
So you have to install it in your local repository before
you can build SupoSE via Maven.

Take a look at install.cmd or install.sh scripts.
