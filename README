Building SupoSE

Currently the commons-cli-2.0 is not released officially.
I have take a checkout from ASF and build a jar file myself.
Currently there is no SNAPSHOT Release nor an beta release
in any Maven 2 Repository available.
So you have to install it in your local repository before
you can build SupoSE via Maven.

The next things you have to download the SVNKit Release from www.svnkit.com
and deploy the given files into your locale repository or may be in your
repository manager.

It's needed to extract the svnkit.jar from the org.tmatesoft.svn_1.2.2.maven.zip 
file which is distributed by TMate Software as a download.
